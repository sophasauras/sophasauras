I'm a university student learning who loves to code; I'm also working for Navy Digital to build experience. I primarily focus on front-end, but am hoping to learn more back-end in the near future. I love making and designing webpages with HTML and CSS.  It's fun to code something that anyone on the web can easily see. I also enjoy programming in C++ and Python because they challenge me more. I love it when I can finally solve a difficult problem.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on learning Python and C++.
- ðŸ˜€ I like to run, code, read, and practice yoga in my free time.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about old shipping laws!
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first line of code was not "Hello World!"

I have experience/learnt through the following:
